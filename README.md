# What is Casa?
We're one of the first AI property search platforms in the UK.

We index the internet, remove duplicate properties then match them with people based on natural language - so seekers can complain as they would to a friend but to our Casa AI. We've lifted the burden of staying actively on top of your property hunt.

The goal is to <b>get time-to-move for renters down to days</b> instead of ~4 weeks. 

History has proven this possible and now it's scalable with advancements in AI  technology that we can use for our assistants.

## What can you try from Casa today?
#### Casa Toolkit (AI tooling suite for real estate professionals) - book a [demo here](https://cal.com/rowan-casa-platform/toolkit-demo).
- We believe it can drive more revenue for listers and better experiences for seekers but are still early in collecting more data.
- It's discounted for that reason.
- Don't be shy (we may even lose money but we'll always lock prices for our early adopters). 
#### Casa Search Application (early access) - try it [here](https://using.casa).
- Live for rentals in London (and being tested so not always perfectly functional).
- This is the easiest way to find a place to rent.
- It's free (hopefully forever).

## What is the future of property search (and proptech on the whole)?
Some think AI is just a fad. We bet they're very wrong. 

The truth is that any task we can do on the internet will (very) soon be fully automated. Right now the possibilities with agentic workflows are endless but the cost of compute is pretty high. 

As the cost of building and scaling AI systems inevitably comes down, personalized experiences will be <b>simple, effective and expected</b>.

For the old (and awful) property platforms they're caught with an innovators dilemma. They've made money for decades from <i>making our lives hard</i> and having you jump through hoops. Whether you're an agent or a home hunter, it's not been a "fun" experience. It might be a while before they consider disrupting themselves with cutting edge technology, like Casa. ðŸ˜‰

Business models and practices will be forced to change by actually giving everyone real value (think being able to preview your life in your new home or even cooler stuff).
